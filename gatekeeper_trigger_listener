# gatekeeper_trigger_listener - OpenWrt init script for gatekeeper event listener
#
# This init script manages the gatekeeper_trigger.sh service as a procd-managed daemon.
# It ensures continuous monitoring of ubus events from dnsmasq and trigger appropriate
# gatekeeper responses for new network device discoveries.
#
# Service Configuration:
# - START=95: Runs late in boot process to ensure network and ubus services are ready
# - USE_PROCD=1: Uses procd daemon management for automatic restart and logging
# - respawn: Automatically restarts service on failure (enhances reliability)
#
# Integration Points:
# - Launches gatekeeper_trigger.sh as a persistent background process
# - Captures stdout/stderr for logread integration
# - Registers with OpenWrt standard init.d service framework
#
# Maintenance:
# After placing this file in /etc/init.d/:
#   chmod +x /etc/init.d/gatekeeper_trigger_listener
#   /etc/init.d/gatekeeper_trigger_listener enable
#   /etc/init.d/gatekeeper_trigger_listener start
#
# To view logs: logread -f | grep gatekeeper_trigger_listener
#
# Restart service: /etc/init.d/gatekeeper_trigger_listener restart
#
# Security:
# - Service runs with standard user privileges (no elevated permissions needed)
# - Procd handles lifecycle management and crash recovery
# - Logs are available through standard OpenWrt logging system

# OpenWrt init system parameters
